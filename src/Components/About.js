         <h3>Design & <br />Development</h3>
             <p>I passed my HSC with an biology subject and eventually at that time, I didn't knew anything about coding and I started learning to code when I was in 1st  year of Engineering and got interest in it when I started learning about web design and development. Over time, I gain wealth of experience designing and developing web applications.</p>
